Create a Netflix-like UI design for my web application. The design should emulate the Netflix website's aesthetic and layout, featuring a dark theme with black or dark gray background, red accents for buttons and highlights, clean sans-serif fonts like Arial or Helvetica, and high-contrast text for readability. Use a responsive grid system to ensure compatibility across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

**Header**: Include a fixed top navigation bar with the app logo on the left (use a placeholder logo, like stylized text 'My App'), navigation links in the center (e.g., Home, Features, About, Contact), and on the right, buttons for 'Log In' and 'Sign Up'. The 'Log In' button should be outlined in white, and 'Sign Up' in red fill. Clicking 'Log In' opens a modal with fields for email/username, password, a 'Remember Me' checkbox, a forgot password link, and a submit button. Clicking 'Sign Up' opens a modal with fields for full name, email, password, confirm password, and a terms agreement checkbox.

**Hero Section**: Below the header, add a full-width hero banner with a background image or video (use a generic abstract image related to the app’s theme), overlaid with a semi-transparent dark gradient. Center a headline like 'Welcome to My App', a subheadline briefly describing the app (e.g., 'Discover amazing features tailored for you'), and a red 'Get Started' button that scrolls to the features section or opens signup.

**Features Section**: Implement a card-based layout like Netflix’s rows of thumbnails. Organize into horizontal rows, each with a category title (e.g., 'Core Features', 'Advanced Tools', 'User Benefits') in bold white text. Each row contains scrollable cards (use CSS for horizontal scrolling with navigation arrows on the sides). Cards should be rectangular (approximately 200x300px on desktop, scaling down on mobile), with rounded corners, a background image or icon at the top, a feature title in bold, a short description, and a 'Learn More' button. Base cards on the app’s existing features, identifying key functionalities (e.g., for a todo app: 'Task Creation', 'Reminders', 'Collaboration'; for a blog: 'Post Editor', 'Comments', 'Search'). Aim for 3-5 rows with 4-6 cards each, using placeholders if specific features are unclear.

**Card Interaction**: When a card is clicked, open a Netflix-style modal window (centered, dark background, rounded corners) displaying the feature’s details: a larger image or icon, the feature title, a detailed description (100-150 words) of what the feature does, and a red 'Get Started' button at the bottom to initiate that feature (e.g., navigate to the feature’s page or trigger its functionality). Include a close button (X) in the top-right corner of the modal.

**Search Bar**: Add a search bar below the header or in the hero section for searching features or content within the app.

**Footer**: Include a dark footer with links to Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Contact Us, social media icons, and copyright information.

Ensure the design is modern, minimalistic, with smooth animations (e.g., card hover effects like scale-up and shadow, modal fade-in), accessibility features (alt text for images, keyboard navigation), and optimized for performance. Provide the design as a Figma file, Sketch mockup, or detailed HTML/CSS/JS code snippet if implementing. If generating an image, create a high-fidelity mockup screenshot of the homepage in 1920x1080 resolution.
